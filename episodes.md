We did a contributing project using the open-source Tic-Tac-Toe game code, with Python and Pygames. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played by two people on a board consisting of three rows and three rows.  It's a winning game by preoccupying three consecutive points (top and bottom, left and right,  diagonal). The disadvantage of the existing TikTakTok game is that the game ends quickly due to the small number of cells. Also, there is an error that you can click on the space even after the game is over. Lastly, it can be confusing because the game doesn't tell you whose turn it is. So we solved the problems mentioned above.
